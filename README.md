_Open Pipeline Working Group_
===============

  

The purpose of pipeline WG is to explore the viability and potential of an modern cloud-ready open-source M&E pipeline project. Considering the complexity of the problem, it is important to discuss the scope of the work, validate existing solutions against that scope and form minimal requirements for all areas that would eventually be covered.
  

Goals of the WG are:

1.  _Define a comprehensive M&E pipeline taxonomy_
2.  _Define the minimum requirements for pipeline core reference implementation_
3.  _Define requirements and scope of a production ready pipeline solution_
4.  _Evaluate and decide on viability of existing pipeline projects for possible adoption and inspiration (license permitting)_
5.  _Discuss and share possible studio scenarios and use-cases for an open M&E pipeline_


Non-goals of the WG are:

1.  _WG should not dive into writing any particular pipeline implementation and DCC integrations at the moment._
