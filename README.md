_This document is intended to be a template for working groups established by the TAC, to be used as the_ [_README.md_](http://README.md) _file in its repository. All items in italics are descriptions of what context should be there; it is intended to be replaced by content. It is modeled off the_ [_CNCF Serverless WG_](https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless)_._

_The intention is that each WG has its own GitHub repo under the_ [_ASWF organization_](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation)_._

_Open Pipeline Working Group_
===============

  

The purpose of pipeline WG is to explore the viability and potential of an modern cloud-ready open-source M&E pipeline project. Considering the complexity of the problem, it is important to discuss the scope of the work, validate existing solutions against that scope and form minimal requirements for all areas that would eventually be covered.
  

Goals of the WG are:

1.  _Define a comprehensive M&E pipeline taxonomy_
2.  _Define the minimum requirements for pipeline core reference implementation_
3.  _Define requirements and scope of a production ready pipeline solution_
4.  _Evaluate and decide on viability of existing pipeline projects for possible adoption and inspiration (license permitting)_
5.  _Discuss and share possible studio scenarios and use-cases for an open M&E pipeline_


\_Non-goals are things that the working group are intentionally choosing not to do, the things not expected to change due to the working groups efforts, or the subject matter areas that the working groups doesn’t want to address at this time. \_

Non-goals of the WG are:

1.  _WG should not dive into writing any particular pipeline implementation and DCC integrations._
